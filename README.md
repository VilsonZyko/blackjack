# blackjack
A simple black jack game created for the second milestone project of the python course.

Few features:
v2 THE PROMPT ASKING PLAYERS FOR ADDITIONAL CHIPS WAS ADDED
v2.1 fixed the bust scenario acting code to freeze. Implemented H as an input for Hit and S for Stand to improve UX.
user note: no need for the input to be a capital letter since a function has been implemented to make sure the input is always uppercase.
v2.2 added check for aces function for the dealer. Added total player chips feedback in case of a tie.
